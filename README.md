# docker compose based Storj environment

`storj-up` is a swiss-army tool to create / customize Storj clusters with the help of `docker compose` (not just storagenode but all satellite and edge services).

This is useful for Storj development and not for Storage Node operator.

## Getting started

It is recommended that you use [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/) as well as [enable Docker BuildKit builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/) for all features to work correctly.

Install the tool:

```
go install storj.io/storj-up@latest
```

Go to an empty directory and initialize docker compose:

```
storj-up init db,core,admin,edge,minimal
```

If you're on a Mac, or running on a remote box, you'll need to tell some services your IP address:

```
storj-up env setenv satellite-api STORJ_CONSOLE_GATEWAY_CREDENTIALS_REQUEST_URL=http://ipaddr:8888
storj-up env setenv satellite-api STORJ_CONSOLE_LINKSHARING_URL=http://ipaddr:9090
storj-up env setenv authservice STORJ_ENDPOINT=http://ipaddr:9999
storj-up env setenv linksharing STORJ_PUBLIC_URL=http://ipaddr:9090
```

Start the cluster:

```
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

You can check the generated credentials with:

```
storj-up credentials
```

You can set the required environment variables with `eval $(storj-up credentials -e)` (at least on Linux/OSX)

Or you can update the credentials of local `rclone` setup with `storj-up credentials -w`

## More features

While the basic `storj-up init` command will give you a barebones local Storj network, which can be used for testing file upload and download,
you can also add more services to the network for testing things like the edge services, and admin API console. Just add the desired services to the init command,
for example

```
storj-up init minimal,satellite-core,satellite-admin,edge,db,billing
```

Will give you all the services required to test the Web UI, the Admin API, and even the billing services. Additionally, there are dedicated subcommands
to modify the services within the `docker-compose.yaml` file easily. The generic form of these commands:

```
storj-up <subcommand> <selector> <argument>
```

Here `selector` can be either a service (like `storagenode`) or a name of a service group. (like `edge`). To find out all the groups, please use `storj-up recipes`

Other services include:
* `mailserver`: a mock smtp server that can be used to view emails sent from the satellite at localhost:1080

### Example: Building specific binaries based on a Gerrit change

After running `storj-up init`, you can use the following command to replace binaries based on a specific Gerrit changeset:

```
storj-up build remote gerrit -f refs/changes/65/6365/1 satellite-api satellite-core satellite-admin uplink
```

You will need to change `refs/changes/65/6365/1` to the Gerrit patchset you want to use, and change the binaries that follow it based on what you are trying to replace.

Then, run `docker compose build` followed by `docker compose up` in order to spin everything up.

### Example: Modify the configuration variable of a service

You can modify configuration variable by setting the environment variables:

```
storj-up env setenv satellite-api STORJ_CONSOLE_CREDENTIALS_REQUEST_URL=http://myservername
```

Available configuration (for selected services) can be listed by `storj-up configs <service>`, for example:

```
storj-up configs storagenode

STORJ_IDENTITY_CERT_PATH                                               path to the certificate chain for this identity (default: $IDENTITYDIR/identity.cert)
STORJ_IDENTITY_KEY_PATH                                                path to the private key for this identity (default: $IDENTITYDIR/identity.key)
STORJ_SERVER_CONFIG_REVOCATION_DBURL                                   url for revocation db (e.g. bolt://some.db OR redis://127.0.0.1:6378?db=2&password=abc123) *(default: bolt://$CONFDIR/revocations.db)
STORJ_SERVER_CONFIG_PEER_CAWHITELIST_PATH                              path to the CA cert whitelist (peer identities must be signed by one these to be verified). this will override the default peer whitelist
...
```

### Example: Using your local satellite installation rather than a remote change

#### Backend

After running `storj-up init`, you can use the following command to replace binaries from your local machine:

**On Linux:**

This will mount the correct binaries from your `$GOPATH/bin`

```
storj-up local-bin satellite-core satellite-admin satellite-api
```

**Mac and Windows:**

This will mount the correct binaries from your `$GOPATH/bin/linux_amd64`

```
storj-up local-bin -s linux_amd64 satellite-core satellite-admin satellite-api
```

You will also need to cross-compile to Linux when you update your local satellite, e.g.

```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go install -race ./cmd/satellite
```

Then if you are not currently running the containers, run

```
docker compose up -d
```

to start the containers.

Or run

```
docker restart up-satellite-core-1 up-satellite-api-1 up-satellite-admin-1
```

(the "up" prefix may be different depending on the location of your docker-compose.yaml file)

to restart already-running containers.

#### Local Development Environment

During development, changes to the code will require building a new binary and restarting the containers.
To simplify this workflow during development, you can supply ENV variables either in the service config or
at the OS level to automatically rebuild the binaries and restart the containers when you use the storj-up
start command.

```
storj-up local-bin satellite-core satellite-admin satellite-api
storj-up env set satellite-core satellite-admin satellite-api STORJ_UP_LOCAL_BINARY_SOURCE=<path_to_storj>/cmd/satellite
storj-up start
```

This will build the source specified and then start the services. Make sure your local binary is mounted in the
service using the `storj-up local-bin` command and that the location mounted is the same location as your default
go/bin directory. If you are not on a Linux OS, the command will automatically attempt to cross-compile the source.

If you wish to always use a local binary across all storj-up instances, you can also set the ENV variable at the OS
level `STORJ_UP_LOCAL_<service_name>=<path_to_build_service>` for a particular service. After setting this, anytime
you have a local binary mounted for this service, you can use `storj-up start` to rebuild the binary and start the
services.

#### Remote Development Environment

If you are developing on a remote machine, or you are using a remote docker daemon on your local machine, you can
set the `STORJ_DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to point to the location of the docker daemon you're using. The IP
or hostname you assign to the env variable will be used by the services for all external API connections. For example,

- **local dev remote daemon**: Set the `STORJ_DOCKER_HOST` environment variable on the local machine to the IP or hostname of the remote docker daemon
you're using.

- **remote dev and daemon**: Set the `STORJ_DOCKER_HOST` environment variable on the remote machine to the IP or hostname of that machine.
Do not use localhost.

Without this setting, or manually adjusting the service config, localhost will be used for all external API calls, and
may return errors when trying to use the services.


#### Frontend

Here, you will need to attach your local web/satellite directory as a volume. Do this with

```
storj-up local-ws /path/to/storj/web/satellite/
```

When you run `npm run build` from your local web/satellite directory, the webapp should be automatically updated, no need to restart any docker containers.

The exception is if you are making a frontend change in web/satellite that requires a corresponding backend change. In this case, you will need to also run `go install ./cmd/satellite` followed by a restart of the relevant containers (see command at the end of the "Backend" section above).

### Interacting with and resetting your Satellite db

`docker compose ps` will list your running containers. Find the one that looks like `<prefix>-cockroach-1`

To run sql on this container,

```
docker exec -it <prefix>-cockroach-1 ./cockroach sql --insecure
```

`show databases;` will list all the databases you can query from. `master` will contain most satellite tables, and `metainfo` contains... metainfo tables.

`use <db>;` will switch to one of those.

`show tables;` will give a list of tables accessible from the selected db.

Then you can run queries like `update users set project_limit=3 where ...;`

#### Resetting

There is a chance that due to going back and forth between db versions will result in errors that look like this in your logs:

```
up-satellite-api-1    | 2022-05-16T17:34:53.916Z        DEBUG   process/exec_conf.go:403        Unrecoverable error     {"error": "Error checking version for satellitedb: validate db version mismatch: expected 196 != 195\n\tstorj.io/storj/private/migrate.(*Migration).ValidateVersions:138\n\tstorj.io/storj/satellite/satellitedb.(*satelliteDB).CheckVersion:138
```

If you are okay with starting with a fresh satellite db, this can be accomplished by running

```
docker compose down -v
```
